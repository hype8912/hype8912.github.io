# General Information
1987 GMC Sierra Classic R1500 \
305 TBI Engine \
700R4 Transmission

## The Story

I purchased the truck in April of 2022. I was originally told that it had the original 305 TBI engine. The truck had three owners with the second owner assuming the vehicle. The original owner purchased the truck and used it as a daily truck for many years. Eventually the truck became a farm truck and was used from time to time. At some point the driver's door was wrecked and replaced with a door from the junk yard. When the original owner died his Son was given ownership of the vehicle. The Son held on to it for a few months but finally decided to sell it as he had no use for it. The Son sold the vehicle to the person I purchased the truck from. The third owner drove the truck from upstate South Carolina to Summerville, SC. They had planned to pull the truck apart and it become the third owners daily drive but he found a 2500 diesel 4x4 squarebody so he decided to sell the truck.

I found the truck on [Facebook Marketplace](https://photos.app.goo.gl/SokMM4RyTdFzPkux8) maybe 30 minutes after it was posted. I test drove the truck and decided to make an offer on the truck for $3500. Once I got the truck home and start looking through it the gremlins started to come out. I replaced the usually stuff when you get a very old vehicle. Oil, oil filter, fuel filter, belts, distributor cap, and distributor rotor. The truck also had a check engine light on since it's the first year with OBD1. The only code was a 21 for Throttle Position Sensor. I decide change the throttle position sensor, rebuild the TBI, and replace the idle air control valve.

After everything I replaced I still had some random gremlins with keeping the truck running or running rough. I found and fixed multiple broken wires or twisted together wires. On August 30th, 2022 the truck broke down on me while my daughters and I were out for a drive. I had the truck towed home. I worked on the truck for a few months testing stuff and shooting wires but I never could get it to run again. After pressure from the HOA for my truck be parked on the curb I had a tow truck company put the vehicle in the garage. It's sat there since. I've slowly worked on stuff.
