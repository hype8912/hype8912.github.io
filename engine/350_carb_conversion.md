# 350 TBI to Carburetor Conversion

Converting to a carburetor allows for the removal of the ECM and makes maintenance much simpler. Converting to a carburetor has two drawbacks through. You'll always have to run ethanol free gas to keep the carburetor from gumming up and it will be a pain to start when it's cold outside.

## Parts Required

* Intake manifold
* Carburetor with auto choke - 600 CFM
* Vacuum Advance Distributor
* Fuel pump time delay relay
* Fuel pressure bypass regulator
* Fuel pressure gauge
* [Torque Converter Lock Up Switch Kit](https://www.ebay.com/itm/263099168550)
