# 305 TBI to TPI Conversion

Converting a TBI (Throttle Body Injected) to TPI (Tuned Port Injection) only provides a small amount of improvement and a different look. Because of the amount of work required it would be better to do a Sniper EFI Conversion.

## Parts Required

* TPI ECU
* TPI manifold and throttle body assembly
* Fuel pump for 40 - 47 psi
  * [AC Delco EP381](https://www.jegs.com/i/ACDelco/065/EP381/10002/-1)
* Fuel lines - PTFE fuel injection
* TPI wiring harness
* Extended throttle cable
* Cruise control cable
* TV cable
* Air box

## Extra Parts

* Electric fan conversion

## Notes

Prefer parts from the 89-92 F-Body because of the MAP sensor versus the 85-88 using a MAF sensor.
