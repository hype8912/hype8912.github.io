# 305 TBI to TPI Conversion
Converting a TBI (Throttle Body Injected) to TPI (Tuned Port Injection) only provides a small amount of improvement and a different look. Because of the amount of work required it would be better to do a Sniper EFI Conversion.

## Parts Required
* TPI ECU
* TPI manifold and throttle body assembly
* Fuel pump for 40 - 47 psi
    * AC Delco EP381
* Fuel lines - PTFE fuel injection
* TPI wiring harness
* Extended throttle cable
* Cruise control cable
* TV cable
* Air box


## Extra Parts
* Electric fan conversion

## Notes
Prefer oarts frin the 89-92 F-Body because of the MAP sensor versus the 85-88 using a MAF sensor.
