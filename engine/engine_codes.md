# Engine Codes
After buying the truck and starting to dig into all the issues I found that the truck no longer had the original 305 engine installed. I was a little heart broken because I really wanted the 305 engine since my first C10 had a 305 engine. After much digging I learned that the engine is basically a cobbled together frankenstin engine. Meaning it's got parts from multiple years.
