# Tail lights

I wanted to make maintenance easier for removing the bed so I didn't have to cut any wiring. To do this I used a 4-way trailer extension cable to make a plug and socket for the tail lights at the end of the bed. If you really wanted to do this correctly so you could add on a trailer plug for towing you would want to use a 5-way trailer plug and socket but the cost of that was more than I was willing to spend right now as a 4-way plug served the purpose I needed.

## 7-pin Trailer Plug

Wiring up a 7-pin trailer plug will be hard since the signal for the turn signal and brake are handled inside the steering column switch.
