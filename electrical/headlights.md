# Headlights Conversion

I chose to convert the 4" x 6" full size headlight assembles to a modern style bulb replacement assembly to make finding parts easier. It also gives you more options of lighting colors and styles. I chose a projector style headlight since I plan to install HID lights in the future.

One of the many things that plagued the C10 series was that the headlights always seemed dim or dimmed when the vehicle was idling. The reason for this is because the electrical power for the headlights runs through the headlight switch and then to the headlights. This creates some limitations on how many amps you can draw through the vehicles wiring and makes the path for power much longer than it needs to be. Modern vehicles use a relay to control the high amperage side of the load and the headlight switch only has to pass enough amps to trigger the magnet in the relay. This drastically increases the amount of amps you can pass directly to the head light bulbs creating brighter lighting and very little dimming at idle. While converting the headlight assemblies I also chose to upgrade the headlight wiring harness to use a pair of relays.

When I replaced the headlamps I also chose to replace the hardware for mounting the headlights along with most of the trim screws and the wiring plugs for the front turn signals.
